Tasks for development

* Support the use of a test instance of Binance:
https://testnet.binance.vision/#faq-periodic-reset
* Integrate with the indicator for entering positions
* Send trading position entry and exit orders
* Provide position and trade information through the REST endpoints.
* Provide some security for our REST API.
* Also subscribe for order book updates. Then instead of entering positions
using MKT orders, send IOC which takes into account the available liquidity.
* Specify schema explicitly for requests. Possibly use: https://pypi.org/project/flask-expects-json/
Flask will then have to be mocked: https://stackoverflow.com/a/30380016/1268949
