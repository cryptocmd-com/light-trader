Tasks for development

* Provide an API request for stopping strategies.
* Record any order execution responses we get in the cloud. A platform we can use is AWS DynamoDB.
* Provide position and trade information through the REST endpoints.
* Also subscribe for order book updates. Then instead of entering positions
using MKT orders, send IOC which takes into account the available liquidity.
* Setup logging into Telegram using a package like https://pypi.org/project/aiolog/
